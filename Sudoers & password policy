----------------	Password policy requirments:	-----------------------------


To set password expiration date (MAX), MIN days to edit password, and the warning message to change the password, we have to edit the login.defs in etc dircorty.
	Serach for: PASS_MAX_DAYS, PASS_MIN_DAYS, PASS_WARN_AGE

To set-up password complexity you first need to install a pckage called "libpam-pwquality", and then edit pwquality in etc/security .


minlen=10 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 reject_username difok=7 enforce_for_root

Difrence on charcter only apply for users, difok = 7 by default not apply for root user.

Why? Root password changes typically don't prompt for the current password due to security reasons. Without access to the current password hash, modules like pam_cracklib cannot compare the new password against it for difok checks.



----------------	Configuring sudoers group:		-----------------------------

You can configure sudoer file by two methods, the first is to Manualy navigate and open the sudoer file on etc, or you can simply run the command sudo visudo.

Command to configure visduo to be open with vim instead of nano:

	1. sudo update-alternatives --config editor
	2. Then choose vim-basic


In case you forgot to add sudo in the command you can use sudo!! to redo the command with sudo previlges.

Adding "Defaults insults" to sudoer file will display an assulat message for every incorect password for sudo user. 

add this rule to configure sudoer file:

Defaults	secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
Defaults	insults
Defaults	passwd_tries=3
Defaults	logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"
Defaults	log_input
Defaults	log_output
Defualts	iolog_dir="/var/log/sudo"
Defaults	requiretty
